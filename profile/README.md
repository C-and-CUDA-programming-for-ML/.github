## C++ for Machine Learning

Welcome to our three day course in C++ in machine learning. We are goint to cover the following topics.

Day 1. Intro to C++ - [exercise](https://github.com/Cpp-programming-for-ML/01_intro_cpp_exercise)

Day 2. Compiling PyTorch models - [exercise](https://github.com/Cpp-programming-for-ML/2_neural_networks_cpp), Extending PyTorch - [exercise](https://github.com/Cpp-programming-for-ML/3_extend_pytorch_padding)

Day 3. Convolutions and Perceptrons in CUDA - [exercise](https://github.com/Cpp-programming-for-ML/4_cpp_conv)
